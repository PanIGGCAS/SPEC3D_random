OTHER VERSIONS OF THE PROGRAM
============
The main characteristic of this version of the software is the implementation of random fields for the constitutive tensor.
This version of the software is mainly developed at laboratoire MSSMat (Ecole Centrale Paris - CNRS).

COMPILATION
============
For compilation of the software under MacOSX, one should install openmpi from http://www.open-mpi.org/ or from Fink

For compilation on any platform, one should have installed and compiled the library dcdflib, available from http://www.netlib.org
